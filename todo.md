## Features
- add interval set button, which works the same way as the add interval button but takes on extra info and makes the desired set of repeated intervals
- download as .mrc button
- Make graph responsive so you can click or hover over an interval bar and it will either give you a tooltip with interval data or it will scroll to the corresponding row of the chart
- responsive table where you can click on and edit any row, also a button to add a new row which you can then fill in. this could replace the add interval button
- have a field to enter your FTP, so when making intervals you can specify the power in watts instead of as a percent, then it uses your FTP to convert to percent for the mrc file. this might be good to put next to the download button
- dark mode/light mode
- info page

## Misc
- remove dependencies for libraries I didn't end up using
